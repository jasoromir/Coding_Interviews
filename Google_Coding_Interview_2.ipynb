THen, instead of counting all the characters of each *subString* taken from the *BigString* and then comparing the total counts, we can start counting, and if we find a character that was not part of the *SmallString* or the count of a character is supperior to the count of the same character in the *SmallString*, we can determine that this *subString* will not be a valid permutation and stop counting, saving time and memory."
